# nd_wordpress_starter_theme
This is a simple starter theme for wordpress with gulp. It uses postcss, sass, babel, jade-php and browsersync.

# How to use it?
Just download the project and run npm install in your terminal. The npm modules will then be installed.
For livereloading you have to edit the gulpfile.js and put your local server in the browserSync task.
You're now able to run the command "gulp" in your terminal and all the files will be compiled & your browser refreshed :)
